                <p>As it is said on your website, your course gives the opportunity to women and non-binaries to study programming and enter the world of IT. Personally, I think that it is a great purpose, to try to bring equality in this branch.<br/>
                    For a long time I was thinking about changing my profession, and your course will give me the possibility to do so. It is also great that your course includes working in teams, which is relevant in future work as a developer.</p>

                <p>I am ambitious and always eager to learn more. In Warsaw, I obtained a master's degree from Academy of Fine Arts - I have a design talent and artistic flair.
                <br/>Also, I like and I am good at communicating with other people.</p>

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p> My name is Dagna Schmidt and in a few days it will be a year since I moved to Sweden, Goteborg. Before, I obtained my education and work experience in Warsaw, Poland. <br/>
            I am an ambitious person, who likes to challenge themself and wouldn't miss a chance to learn and develop. I like to act and I do not give up on my goals. <br/>
            I am aware that group work and good relations with other people, at work and in life, can make a bigger result than trying to achieve everything alone. For 3 years I was a member of the powerlifting national team and I can truly said, that all my medals are a team effort.</br>
            My attitude is always positive and I strongly believe that with a knowlegde you offer I will have a great future in the IT world.  </p>
